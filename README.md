# IE-9-Placeholder-Directive-For-AngularJS
Placeholder for IE works with angularJS 1.3.x 

Old 1.2.x angularJS placeholder directive no longer works with 1.3.x all form related validation were broken once I upgraded to 1.3.x. This does not require JQuery.
This directive works in Ie9 and should also work for other IE version with all version of angularJS.

/**
 * Placeholder for non-HTML5 browsers ... specifically IE8 and IE9, but also
 * works with Firefox 3 and possibly others.
 *
 * 
 *
 * Quick Usage:
 *
 *     <input ng-model="xyz" placeholder="Enter Value" />
 *
 *     <textarea ng-model="xyz" placeholder="Enter Value"
 *         placeholder-class="placeholder"></textarea>
 *

This directive will work with form controller. All flags require, valid invalid etc will work as it use to be in 1.x version of angularJs.
