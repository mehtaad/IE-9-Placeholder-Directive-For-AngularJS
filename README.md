# IE-9-Placeholder-Directive-For-AngularJS
Placeholder for IE works with angularJS 1.3.x 

Old 1.2.x angularJS placeholder directive no longer works with 1.3.x
This directive works in Ie9 and should also work for other IE version

/**
 * Placeholder for non-HTML5 browsers ... specifically IE8 and IE9, but also
 * works with Firefox 3 and possibly others.
 *
